This is my Portfolio Website build with HTML,Bootstrap and Django. Here are four pages such as “Home” , “About” , “Projects” and “Contact Me”. “Contact Me” form is connected with the Django Backend 
and a SQLite database where a user can input the required information in the contact form and send the response to the backend. Here we have a “Customized Admin interface” to see all the response data 
from the user.
